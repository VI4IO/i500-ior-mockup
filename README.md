# IO500-IOR-Mockup

This repository uses an unmodified IO500 benchmark and links it with an MDTest/IOR mockup that 
could be replaced to create the expected pattern but follow a different semantics.
Unfortunately, a replacement of aiori is not sufficient to gain the full benefits of the certain APIs.
